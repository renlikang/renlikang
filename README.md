Cloud Gameing

Build the system of cloud gaming, which is a type of online gaming that runs video games on remote servers and streams them directly to a user’s device.

Used cloud devices to map the rendered game to user devices (pc, phone, pad) through the network, and use the network to send user operation instructions back to the cloud.

Used socket/websocket to transmit the live voice picture of the host/user to the user device (pc, phone, pad), so that the host and user can interact.
